I am a UI engineer and designer living in Portland,&nbsp;OR and a <i>Web Developer</i> at <a href='https://theprogrampdx.com' rel='external noreferrer noopener' target='_blank' aria-label='Visit The Program Website'>The Program</a>. I've always been inspired by and excited about visual design and front end development &mdash; both have been my passion for the past six years. The web is for everyone, thus a website should be usable and enjoyable for anyone. That is the bar I set for&nbsp;myself.
