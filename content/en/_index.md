Thanks for stopping by! I'm a developer and designer living in Portland,&nbsp;OR. I've always been inspired by and excited about visual design and front end development &mdash; both have been my passion for the past six years. As the <i>Design Lead and Front End</i> at Dice Services, I maintained and developed the company and product websites while I oversaw and managed all design. Again, websites should be simple, accessible, responsive, and&nbsp;fast. That is a bar I set for&nbsp;myself.
